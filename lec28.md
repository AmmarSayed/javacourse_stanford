## **2. Final Exam Review**

The instructor provides an overview of the **final exam topics**, specifying what to study and what to skip.

### **What’s NOT on the Final**

- **Carol the Robot**
- **Stack/Heap diagrams**
- **Bit operations on images**
- **Polar coordinates**
- **Layouts (e.g., BorderLayout)**
- **Sorting algorithms**
- **Threads and standard Java topics**

### **Key Topics to Study**

1. **Basic Programming Concepts**

   - Syntax, loops, and control structures.
   - Objects, classes, interfaces, and constructors.

2. **Method Calls & Data Types**

   - Understanding **pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference**.
   - Difference between **primitives** and **objects**.

3. **Strings and Characters**

   - Know **string manipulation** functions (e.g., concatenation, substring).
   - Operations involving characters from strings.

4. **Graphics and Event-Driven Programming**

   - Familiarity with the **ACM graphics library** (e.g., GObject, GOval).
   - Understanding **mouse and action listeners** (no need to know key listeners).

5. **Data Structures: Arrays and ArrayLists**

   - Understand when to use **arrays vs. ArrayLists**.
   - Be comfortable with **multidimensional arrays** (2D or 3D).

6. **Java Collections**

   - Know **HashMaps** and **iterators**.
   - Be able to **iterate over keys and values** in a collection.

7. **Files**
   - Focus on **reading from files** (writing to files is less likely to be tested).

## **3. Example Final Exam Questions**

The instructor provides **sample questions** to illustrate the level of difficulty expected on the final.

### **HashMap Problem**

- **Problem:** Find all keys in a `HashMap<String, String>` where the key is identical to its value.
- **Solution Sketch:**
  - Iterate over the **keys** using an iterator.
  - Use `map.get(key)` to retrieve the value.
  - If `key.equals(value)`, print the key.

### **Target Seeker Example**

- **Concept:** Simulate a **black square "seeking" a red target** that moves to the mouse location when clicked.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Use **mouse listeners** to update the target’s position.
  - Implement logic to move the **black square step-by-step** toward the red target.

## **4. Final Thoughts and Course Wrap-up**

The instructor reflects on the **progress students have made** throughout the course, from having little or no programming experience to now being able to build complex programs, like **games, social networks, and data-driven applications**.

He emphasizes the **scientific and artistic elements** of computer science:

- **The science**: Learning core **concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques**.
- **The art**: Developing **creative and elegant solutions** through programming.

The instructor encourages students to **think of themselves as artists** when writing code, citing a famous quote by **Donald Knuth**, the "father of modern computer science":

> "Programmers do better if they subconsciously think of themselves as artists."
